		<h2>what is sustainable fashion</h2>
			<p>The fashion industry is one of the leading causes of pollution to our planet. Fast fashion brands create cheap clothes in mass numbers to appeal to trends in hopes to sell as much as possible. This is very damaging to our planet. Because companies create so many pieces, there’s always excess waste that eventually end up in landfills. Additionally, many major brands outsource labor overseas where work conditions may not be the greatest. <br><br>

			The goal of sustainable fashion is to reduce or eliminate those issues. Sustainable fashion brands aim to create products that don’t hurt the environment in an ethical manner. These brands support fair wages for its workers, use environmentally-friendly materials, and reduce carbon footprint by creating products locally.</p>
