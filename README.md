## Project Goals
* Continue practicing HTML, CSS, and Flexbox by creating a landing page for a mock fashion brand

## Project Background
Earth Ally was a mock fashion brand that I created in 2020. I created this landing page design in Adobe InDesign. I decided to recreate the design but by using web development tools.


## About the Design
For this project, I wanted to practice web design. To keep the scope of the project minimal I decided to create a landing page. This landing page is for a mock sustainable fashion brand I named Earth Ally.

Before beginning this landing page, I did some research on the goals of landing pages and somefundamentals to help me understand how viewers convert to customers.
To establish this mock brand, I researched sustainability and its common practices to reach its goals. I approached this mock brand with simplcity and minimalism in mind. Sustainability is often associated with being conscious of the Earth and the environment. I chose a neutral and earthy color palette for Earth Ally to reflect this down-to-Earth impression.

Earth Ally is targeted towards those wanting to practice sustainability by purchasing clothes from a brand that shares the same goals and values. I wanted to make it clear what Earth Allyâ€™s goals were so I decided it was important to include a section sharing its goals on the landing page.
